 * Fetch slapos.cfg from web (slapos.cfg.example)
 * slapprepare should be integrated into slapos.core egg
 * buildout.cfg.in should not include anything but the extend.
 * RPM : Add build dependency to chrpath
 * Current Makefile has a bug : supervisor (and others) rely on some files from
   build directory. So, of course, when build directory does not exist, it 
   crashes.
 * RPM : should we depend on python?
